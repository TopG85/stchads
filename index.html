                            <p class="card-text text-muted">Pastoral Care continues to remain a priority in our church life. We have a team of 7 people and the two full time clergy who are dedicated to ensuring that people in our church, and those known to it are cared for pastorally. Other members of the congregation also care for one another and support those in need. The official team meets on a monthly basis to update each other on people who have been visited and contacted. We pray for them and ensure that, as far as possible, people receive the support and care that a church family should offer one another.</p>
                            <p class="card-text text-muted">It has been very sad to lose some key members of our church family over the past year and we grieve with their families as we thank God for their lives and service.</p>
                            <p class="card-text text-muted">As well as the team efforts we have a strong group of homegroups that meet every couple of weeks and look out for each other on an ongoing basis. As new people start to attend we are seeing these groups growing.</p>

                            <p class="card-text text-muted">Our Outreach Ministry is a major part of what we do at St Chad's and can be divided into three areas. Our support is both financial and in prayer and participation.</p>
                            <p class="card-text text-muted">Ministries of Mercy. We have continued in 2023/2024 to offer local and global acts of love and kindness to people in need. Our Pastoral Care is a part of this work, and described elsewhere in this report, as is our work in partnership with Hope Central. In addition to these two big areas we seek to reach out to national and international charities with finance and support. We continue to support the Manchester based charity, Hope for Justice, that work to stop modern day slavery. Internationally we support The Leprosy Mission, Barnabas, Open Doors, Christian Solidarity Worldwide and TearFund. All these organisations are seeking to help those in need.</p>
                            <p class="card-text text-muted">International Church growth and Evangelism. We have built a strong link with Bob & Debbie Adhikary's ministry in Nepal. Steve and his wife, Jo plan to visit them again in November this year. Natasha Fraser is now working for GFA international, and we finished our support to Rebecca Mwape this year as she finished her nursing qualifications in Zambia. We also continue support the Medes and the Hembroughs who work in Turkey, both of whom were able to visit us this year and share an update.</p>
                            <p class="card-text text-muted">National and local Evangelism and outreach. Our support for work in schools is done through Christians in Schools Trust, and with Steve's direct work as Chair of Governors at Handforth Grange School and Diocesan Trustee on the Frank Field Education Trust. The school obtained Outstanding in a recent Ofsted Report and won the TES school of the year award. We also support Howie Pickering, the True Freedom Trust and Capernwray Bible School. As a local church we have also run Alpha courses and seen people come to faith.</p>
                            <p class="card-text text-muted">We have also been tremendously blessed by being joined by people from all over the world.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title text-dark">Our Vision</h4>
                            <p class="card-text text-muted">Psalm 127 vs 1 says: Unless the LORD builds the house, the builders labour in vain. Unless the LORD watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain.</p>
                            <p class="card-text text-muted">As we think about vision it is essential to have this verse in our minds at all times. Churches can set visions and make strategies and can actually increase numbers in the congregation but unless the Lord builds the house our work is in vain. I take that to mean that building church numerically is not the same as building the house. In the letters of both Peter and Paul they both use the metaphor of a church as being a living house. People joined together to become a house where God himself dwells. This is a very different idea than simply growing a congregation numerically. It speaks of individuals growing in their relationship with the Lord and with each other. It speaks of individuals learning to use the gifts they've been given and serving others in some way in the church family.</p>
                            <p class="card-text text-muted">So, as we look at our vision for the coming year we have this mind set in our forethought. And we have set ourselves four aims this coming year. The first aim is to grow our children's work. We have generally grown numerically over the past year or two. We have grown in diversity of nationalities and ages, but we are still lacking younger families and children. We rejoice in those we have coming and are seeking to add to the number of younger families coming into the church.</p>
                            <p class="card-text text-muted">Secondly, we plan to take our community outreach with Hope Central to a new level. Working in partnership with CAP and their 'pilot' Community and Church Development Program we aim to grow the involvement of Church with Hope Central in blessing our community.</p>
                            <p class="card-text text-muted">Thirdly, we want to ensure new people joining the church are made to feel really welcome, to feel integrated into the church family and find a place to serve and grow at St Chad's.</p>
                            <p class="card-text text-muted">Finally, we are developing the infrastructure of our Church management by developing a new website and computer functionality within the office of the church. This will help with our day to day management and our communication with those seeking to find out more about us.</p>
                            <p class="card-text text-muted">All of these developments sit alongside our basic aim to 'Know Christ and to Make Him Known.'</p>
